# Set up and manage your camera and microphone

Video calls work directly in a browser,Â  third-party extensions and apps installation isn't required.

When you first launch the Meet, a browser requests access to the camera and microphone. The use of video and audio on our site is allowed or prohibited based on your response.

**Please, note**: For correct work of Meet, allow the browser to use the camera and microphone on our site.

If you don't want other participants to see or hear you, you can manage the camera and microphone both before and during the call, see more below.

## How to allow camera and microphone usage when you first launch Meet?

After you first visit the Meet conference or webinar creating page, a dialog box will appear asking you to allow using the camera, click the Allow / Allowed button:

**Please, note!** If you accidentally clicked Don't Allow, the camera and microphone will be disabled. To enable the camera and microphone, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/streaming/troubleshooting/meet-issues/fix-the-camera-or-microphone-if-they-do-not-work" target="_blank">article</a>.
