Every server has one free IPv4, but you can order up to 14 IPv4 and 14 IPv6 additional addresses for dedicated servers and up to 9 IPv4 and 9 IPv6 addresses for virtual servers (there is one exception: only three additional IP of each type can be ordered for KVM-SSD-1) at extra charge.


Go to Virtual Private Servers in the Control Panel.

Enter a number of IPs and pay for your order.


After finishing the order, configure the IPs on your server. To configure a high number of IPs automatically reinstall your operating system.


How to move IPs from one server to another


Only additional IPs can be moved, the main IP stays associated with the server. Notice that it is a paid service.


To move additional IPs from one server to another, contact us via a chat or create a ticket in the Control Panel.
