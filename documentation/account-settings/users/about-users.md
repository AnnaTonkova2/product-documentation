A user can have one of the four roles in the account:

*   **Users** can look through statistics and resource settings but can't change anything except their own personal data (name, email, password)
*   **Purge and Prefetch** users can only see statistics and resource settings and send purge and prefetch requests. You can select the type only for the API requests or both for the API and web interface.
*   **Engineers** can change services settings and personal data (name, email, password), purge and prefetch CDN servers cache
*   **Administrators** have full rights (including adding, editing, and deleting other users).
