What is VAT?
------------

**The Value Added Tax, or VAT** is a consumption tax assessed on the value added to goods and services.

The VAT rate is calculated depending on the user type (organization or individual) and the user country.

**For example:**

**1\. You are registering as an organization:**

Let's assume that your organization is registered in Germany and you have provided our managers with a VAT number, so the VAT rate, according to the table, will be 0%.

! However, if you did not provide our managers with a VAT number, the VAT rate will be 19%.

**Important!** For Luxembourg, the VAT rate was temporarily decreased from 17% to 16%.

**2\. You are registering as an individual:**

You yourself or as a representative of your organization has registered through the site, without entering into a contract with our company.

According to the table below, the VAT rate will depend on your country, for example, for Germany — 19%, and for China — 0%.
