What is a Raw Logs feature?
---------------------------

Raw Logs is an option that enables an automatic export of CDN resource logs to your storage. Logs contain information about user requests sent to cache servers and pre-cache servers (if [origin shielding](https://www.gcore.com/support/articles/214080309/) is enabled). 

**Note**: The feature is paid. To activate, contact us via [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcorelabs.com). After activation, enable "Raw Logs" in your control panel and configure export to S3, FTP, or SFTP storage.

Export logs to an S3 storage
----------------------------

### Amazon storage

1\. Leave the box "Do not send empty logs" checked if you don't want to receive empty logs. If you want to receive empty logs, uncheck it.

2\. If you use our [shielding option](https://gcorelabs.com/support/articles/214080309/), you can see a checkbox "Add logs from origin shielding". Check the box if you want to receive logs from both edge servers and pre-cache shielding servers. 

3\. For storage type, select "Amazon".

4\. Specify your access key ID. In your Amazon personal account, it is called "AWS access Key ID". You can find it using the [instruction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html). An access key ID and secret access key are required to configure log export to your storage.

5\. Specify your secret access key. In your Amazon personal account, it is called "AWS secret access Key". You can find it using the [instruction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).

6\. Specify your AWS region — the location of a server where your storage is hosted. This is optional: for most storages, the region is determined automatically. You can leave the field empty. But we recommend filling it out to ensure that your logs are exported successfully.

7\. Choose how to organize storage: put logs of all CDN resources into one bucket or use separate buckets for each CDN resource. 

8\. Specify bucket(s) for log export. Make sure you indicate an existing bucket. Otherwise, your logs cannot be exported. Specify a folder name if you want to export logs to a specific folder within a bucket.  

9\. Click "Save changes".

Non-Amazon storage
------------------

1\. Leave the box "Do not send empty logs" checked if you don't want to receive empty logs. If you want to receive empty logs, uncheck it.

2\. If you use our [shielding option](https://gcorelabs.com/support/articles/214080309/), you can see a checkbox "Add logs from origin shielding". Check the box if you want to receive logs from both edge servers and pre-cache shielding servers.

3\. For storage type, select "Other".

4\. Specify a hostname — a name that is assigned to a storage server within a network and is used instead of an IP address. If you use [Gcore S3 storage](https://gcorelabs.com/storage/), you can find its access key ID in your personal account in the "[Hostname](https://gcorelabs.com/support/articles/360002072257/#h_01G1110V67GGHCB9Z6BB30HK35)" field.

5\. Specify your access key ID. Along with a secret access key, it is required to configure log export to your storage. If you use [Gcore S3 storage](https://gcorelabs.com/storage/), you can find its access key ID in your personal account in the "[Access key](https://gcorelabs.com/support/articles/360002072257/#h_01G1110V67GGHCB9Z6BB30HK35)" field.

6\. Specify your secret access key. If you use [Gcore S3 storage](https://gcorelabs.com/storage/), you can find its secret access key in your personal account in the "[Secret key](https://gcorelabs.com/support/articles/360002072257/#h_01G1110V67GGHCB9Z6BB30HK35)" field.

7\. Specify a bucket hostname — a bucket ID that is used by your S3 storage system in the {bucket\_name}.{hostname} format. It is required to ensure that logs are exported to a correct bucket within a storage. This field is optional: for some storages, a bucket hostname is determined automatically. If you use Gcore or Yandex.Cloud storage, a bucket hostname is required. A bucket hostname of the Gcore storage looks as follows: {bucket name}.{hostname from step 3}. For example: _examplename.s-ed1.cloud.gcore.lu_. A bucket hostname of Yandex.Cloud storage looks as follows: {bucket name}.{Yandex.Cloud hostname}}. For example: _examplename.storage.yandexcloud.net_.

8\. Specify a region — location ID of a server where your storage is hosted. This is optional: for some storages, the region is determined automatically. You can leave the field empty. If you use [Gcore S3 storage](https://gcorelabs.com/storage/), a location ID is required. You can find it in the "Details" of the storage. Your location ID is a part of your hostname to the first dot.

9\. Choose how to organize storage: put logs of all CDN resources into one bucket or to use separate buckets for each CDN resource.

10\. Specify bucket(s) for log export. Make sure you indicate an existing bucket. Otherwise, your logs cannot be exported. If you want to export logs to a specific folder within a bucket, specify a folder name.

11\. Click "Save changes".

Export logs to an FTP/SFTP storage
----------------------------------

1\. Leave the box "Do not send empty logs" checked if you don't want to receive empty logs. If you want to receive empty logs, uncheck it.

2\. If you use our [shielding option](https://support.edgecenter.ru/knowledge_base/item/257977https://gcorelabs.com/support/articles/214080309/), you can see a checkbox "Add logs from origin shielding". Check the box if you want to receive logs from both edge servers and pre-cache shielding servers.

3\. Specify a hostname — a name that is assigned to a storage server within a network and is used instead of an IP address. If you use [Gcore SFTP storage](https://gcorelabs.com/storage/), you can find its hostname in the "Details" of the storage in the "[Hostname](https://gcorelabs.com/support/articles/360002072257/#h_01G1111255BHCD4GQX8M7G386V)" field. It looks as follows: ams_.origin.gcdn.co_. Additionally, you can specify an FTP or SFTP storage port by adding a colon after the hostname. For example: _ams.origin.gcore.co:2200_.

4\. Specify a storage username. If you use [Gcore SFTP storage](https://gcorelabs.com/storage/), you can find its username in the "Details" of your storage in the "[Storage/User name](https://gcorelabs.com/support/articles/360002072257/#h_01G1111255BHCD4GQX8M7G386V)" field.

5\. Enter your storage password. 

6\. Specify a folder for export. If you use [Gcore SFTP storage](https://gcorelabs.com/storage/), specify the root (home) folder where other folders originate from. You can find its name in the "Details" of your SFTP storage at the end of the "Upload path" field.  
  
<img src="https://support.gcore.com/hc/article_attachments/5620132659217/image_1379.png" alt="image_1379.png">

If you use an SFTP storage from another provider, clarify whether a root folder that includes other folders is created by default. If not, leave the field empty. If yes, specify a folder name. 

7\. Choose how to organize storage: put logs of all CDN resources into one folder or to use separate folders for each CDN resource. Then specify a folder name. If you specify a non-existent folder, logs will be exported to a root folder. 

8\. Click "Save changes".

Export time intervals
---------------------

Logs are exported at the end of each hour. If you activate Raw Logs at 00:30, the first logs will be exported between 00:45 and 01:00, and the next ones — between 01:45 and 02:00.

If CDN servers are not requested and the box "Do not send empty logs" is unchecked, an empty log file (± 20 bytes) will be sent to your storage.

You can see the status of the Raw Logs option in your control panel:

*   "Pending" is a status for the time interval between the connection to a storage and the very first log export
*   "OK" is a status showing that logs are exported from at least one CDN server
*   "Failed" is a status indicating that an error occurred while connecting to a storage or that the service failed to export logs within 24 hours
*   "Pause" is a status showing that the option is paused

Not all fields are important. Some of them relate to our internal CDN system and are not meaningful for you. In the table below, we have highlighted such system fields in italics. Other fields can be helpful for traffic analysis or statistics.
