Activate Service  
==================

If the Activate Service checkbox is enabled, a client can use the service.

You can disable the service by unchecking the checkbox.<img src="https://reseller.support.gcore.com/hc/article_attachments/360019000538/activate_srrvive.png" alt="activate_srrvive.png">

 When the service is disabled, the client sees the request form.

**Please, note!** Service deactivation doesn't automatically stop resources. If you want to suspend them use TrialEnd or Paused statuses.

Trial Settings 
===============

Use this tab to change trial period settings.

By default, the trial period for Storage lasts 14 days but may end earlier if a client exceeds the limit on Storage trial volume (100 GB).

You can change the trial period setting:

*   The Trial end date field sets the end date of the trial period. 
*   Change the value of the Trial storage volume field to increase the trial period traffic limit,

On the Dashboard page, clients see how many Storage trial days are left.<img src="https://reseller.support.gcore.com/hc/article_attachments/360018960137/___________________________.png" alt="___________________________.png">

Transition to Deleted status 
=============================

After the specified number of days, the Storage service status switches from TrialEnd/Paused to Deleted.

All the client's resources and files in Storage will be deleted. To change the number of days for a specific client, email us to [support@gcorelabs.com](mailto:support@gcorelabs.com).<img src="https://reseller.support.gcore.com/hc/article_attachments/360019000838/_____.png" alt="_____.png">
