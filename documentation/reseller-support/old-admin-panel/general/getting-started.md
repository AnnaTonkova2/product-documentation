# Getting started

Once we create a reseller account you'll get an email with the registration confirmation link. Follow the link to set a password. The link will be active for 24 hours. Write to [support@gcorelabs.com](mailto:support@gcorelabs.com) if the link expires or you experience other issues. 

Admin control panel enterance URL is [http://admin.gcorelabs.com/](http://admin.gcorelabs.com/).

What's next?
============

Reseller is your account admin. Only one user in your organization can be a Reseller. This user can add Sellers, set up account branding and generate Statistics reports in the admin control panel.

Inviting Sellers
----------------

Seller is an additional user who has access to the admin control panel. Users with this role can add clients and set up their resources. There are no limits to the number of Sellers for one organization

You can read on Seller account creating and management in [this article](https://reseller.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005733525).

Setting up client control panel
-------------------------------

In the client control panel, clients can set up their services, check statistics and contact technical support. With no additional settings, your clients will be seeing G-Core Labs clients' control panel which has our corporate colors, logo and is based at https://control.gcorelabs.com.

If you are using your own control panel and just need our API documentation to integrate your service with ours, here are the links:

*   [Reseller API documentation](https://reseller.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005838145),
*   [Services API documentation](https://docs.gcorelabs.com/cdn/).

If you and your clients are going to use the client control panel and you would like to change its look, read the following articles:

*   [How to set up control panel services URLs](https://reseller.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002574458),
*   [Branding](https://reseller.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005733445).

Creating client accounts
------------------------

After you log into the admin control panel you'll be transferred to the Clients section. Here you can create and edit your clients' accounts (clients are unable to register in your control panel on their own). Both Sellers and Reseller can create client accounts. You can read more on creating client accounts in [this article](https://reseller.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005733585).

Along with the Reseller account, we create a client account with the same email and company name. This account is used for collecting your clients' stats, generating monthly reports (more on it in [this article](https://reseller.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000193485)), keeping track of your Sellers and Reseller accounts (they are considered the users for that client). Also, we recommend creating CDN Resources for the client control panel services in this account (more on it in [this article](https://reseller.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002574458)). This account can't be deleted.

Service management
------------------

All our services are available for reselling: CDN, DDoS Protection, Media Platform, Cloud, and Storage. When signing the contract, you discuss with your manager what services you want to resell. By default, the selected services will be displayed in the client's control panel. You can adjust the visibility of products to all customers in the "Services" section of the admin panel:

You can also override the General settings from the "Services" section in the client settings. To go to Settings, click on the wrench icon next to the desired client. If you click on the arrow icon you'll log in the client control panel under client's admin user

<img src="https://reseller.support.gcore.com/hc/article_attachments/360005261678/blobid0__4_.png" alt="blobid0__4_.png">

On the "Settings" -> "Services" tab, select the services that you want to display in the client's control panel.

Please note that displaying a service in the control panel does not allow the client to manage it by default. If the service is displayed but not configured (see the service management articles below), the customer will see the service activation request window:

When submitting an activation request, G-Core Labs technical support or you —depending on the setting of the "Support email" field in the "[Branding](https://reseller.gcorelabs.com/hc/ru/articles/115005733445)" section — will receive an email about the client's wish to access the service.
