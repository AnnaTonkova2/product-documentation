To participate in our referral program, use a referral link from the Control Panel. Place it on your website, forum or any other internet resource. If your customers click on it, they will be redirected to our site, where they will be able to purchase our products.  

When they purchase our products, you get a monetary bonus. The bonus is transferred to your account at the end of each month.

To get a referral link and activate the affiliate program, go to your Control Panel. In the Client section, open Referral Program tab. Everyone starts with a 12% bonus.
