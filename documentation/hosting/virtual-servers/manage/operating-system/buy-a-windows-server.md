Features of a Windows server
----------------------------

1\. Windows can be installed **only when you order a server.**

2\. If you purchase Windows 2012, you can reinstall it from the server control panel.

3\. You can switch from Windows to another operating system [using templates.](https://support.gcore.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003754285)  
**Important! After reinstalling the operating system (from Windows to another one) the Windows OS license cost (25 €) will continue to be charged.** We recommend purchasing a new server with the required OS instead of reinstalling the operating system.
