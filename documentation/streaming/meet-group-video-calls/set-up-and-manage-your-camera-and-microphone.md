Video calls work directly in a browser,Â  third-party extensions and apps installation isn't required.

When you first launch the Meet, a browser requests access to the camera and microphone. The use of video and audio on our site is allowed or prohibited based on your response.

**Please, note!** For correct work of Meet, allow the browser to use the camera and microphone on our site.

If you don't want other participants to see or hear you, you can manage the camera and microphone both before and during the call, see more below.
