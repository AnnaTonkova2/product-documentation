S3 Storage limits
-----------------

1.  You can create maximum 1000 buckets. 
2.  You can place maximum 1 million objects in one bucket. However, we recommend placing no more than 100 thou objects, so storage performance and availability be higher. If you want to place more than 100 thou ones, it would be better to store them in different buckets.
