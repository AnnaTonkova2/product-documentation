If you initiated a password reset but have not received an email within 15 minutes, check your spam folder. The message is titled as “Password Recovery” and sent from [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com).

If you cannot find the email, [start the reset process again](https://auth.gcorelabs.com/login/forgot-password).

If there is still no email, contact us.
