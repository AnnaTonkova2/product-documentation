# Sellers account creation and management

Use the Sellers tab to add, edit or delete users with Sellers rights.

Creating Seller accounts
========================

To add a Seller go the Sellers tab and click on the Add Seller button.

In a new window specify the Seller's name, email and phone number then click on the Send Invite button. An email with the password set up link will be sent to the specified email. The link will be active for 24 hours.

There is an Account status column on the Sellers tab where you can see whether a Seller has followed the link (status Activated) in the email or not (status Not activated).

If the link has expired a Reseller can resend the invitation: go to the Sellers tab -> click on the Seller's settings (screw key) and click on the Resend Invite button (the button is shown only if a user hasn't activated the account; the timestamp of the last invitation is also shown above the button).

Deleting Seller accounts
========================

The Delete seller button is in the Sellers settings in the upper-right corner. Once an account is deleted the Seller loses access to the admin panel and password recovery. The user profile (name, email, phone) also becomes unavailable.

Seller password recovery
========================

To reset Seller's password use one of two ways:

1\. To go the Seller's settings and click on the Reset password button.

2\. Ask Seller to Reset password via the login form on [admin.gcorelabs.com](https://admin.gcorelabs.com/#/clients).

The old password stops working only once the new password is set up.
