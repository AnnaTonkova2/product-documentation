# About volumes

A volume is a file storage which is similar to traditional hard disks (SSD and HDD) but is located in the cloud.

Gcore Cloud uses a software-defined distributed file system to store data. This system comprises a cluster of easily scalable nodes that provide storage, triple data replication, and load distribution. These features ensure that volumes are highly available.

 When you connect to an instance, you may need to store data or manage information. This is where volumes come in - they provide a convenient way to store and manage data within the instance.
