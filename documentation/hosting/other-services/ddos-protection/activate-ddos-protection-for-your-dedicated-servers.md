Server Protection is provided for a dedicated (physical) server â€” both rented from us and third-party. You can also rent a new server with protection.

**To order protection for a rented server**, [send the request through technical support](https://support.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003753885). Please note: the main IP of the server will be changed after we set up the protection. Specify in your request:

*   Server ID
*   OSI layers to be protected (L3-L4 or L3-L7)
*   Protection mode (on-demand or always-on)
*   Bandwidth
*   Whitelist and blacklist of IP (optional, you can send it later)

**To order protection for a third-party server**, fill out an application at the bottom of the [Server Protection](https://gcorelabs.com/ddos-protection-for-servers/) section of our website. Specify in the application:

*   You contact details
*   Location of your equipment
*   Subnet of your equipment
*   Whitelist and blacklist of IP (optional, you can send it later)

**To rent a new server with the Server Protection**, select the configuration of the server in the [Dedicated servers](https://gcorelabs.com/hosting/dedicated/) section of our website and fill out an application at the bottom of the page. Specify in it:
