A volume is a file storage which is similar to SSD and HDD hard disks but located in the cloud.

Gcore Cloud uses a software-defined distributed file system for data storage, which is an easily scalable node cluster. System nodes provide storage and triple data replication, as well as load distribution, which guarantees high availability of volumes.

Use volumes for information storage and data management when connecting to an instance.
