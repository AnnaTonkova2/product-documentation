# Organize uploaded videos

## How to organize videos

There are two ways to organize videos in the Control panel:

- Use folders—separate directories for the videos.
- Use tags—grouping keywords.

Let’s examine the difference between the two ways. For example, you have 100 videos in the Streaming storage. They have been divided into two folders by date: 50 videos in the "10.31.2022" folder and another 50—in the "11.01.2022". You need to group videos by other criteria: "teaser", "clip", and "short film" types. To do this, you do not need to create new folders and lose the date separation. You can add relevant tags to the appropriate videos. The tag list will appear in the control panel, and you can filter videos by them. The videos will still be in two folders.

## How to use folders

### Delete a folder

**Note**: Videos from the folder will be permanently deleted, and you won’t be able to restore them. If you want to delete only the folder, don’t forget to move the videos to another one prior to deleting it.

To delete a folder with content, click the ```···``` icon opposite the relevant folder, select **Remove directory**, and confirm the actions.
