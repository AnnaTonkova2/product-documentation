Ensure that your CNAME record has been [configured](https://support.gcore.com/hc/en-us/articles/213969769-%D0%A1NAME) in a proper way before using it for integrationÂ (eg, _http://cdn.site.com/path/to/your/assets_).

<img src="https://support.gcore.com/hc/ru/article_attachments/115000081769/5.JPG" alt="">Now you can use your asset at the website.

If you have already had created assets, edit them replacing URL with CNAME that you specified in the G-Core [control panel](https://control.gcdn.co/).

Save changes.

Integration has been completed! We highly recommend you to check the HTML code of your web page to ensure that URLs have been rewritten properly from your original ones to CNAME from the control panel.

To do that press F12 or open Developers Tools in your browser, choose the Network tab and refresh the page. All static files should have your CNAME in URLs.
