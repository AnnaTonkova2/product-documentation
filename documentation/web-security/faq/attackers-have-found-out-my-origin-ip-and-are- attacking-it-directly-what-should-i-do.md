Ask the hosting provider for a new IP address (preferably from a different subnet). Change the origin IP in the [control panel settings](https://support.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000578457-DDoS-Protection-Setup). 

Set up [ACL](https://support.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000579237-Origin-Access-Restrictions) to allow access only to the trusted IPs and subnets.
