To activate the service [create a resource](https://support.gcorelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000578457-DDoS-Protection-Setup) and change the A-record in your DNS settings. It will take time for the DNS records to get updated (depends on the TTL (time-to-live) record set on your server, which defines DNS records caching time).
