By SSH


If your server is running Linux, use the console to connect to it via SSH. Note that your server must be connected to the Internet.


For Windows, you can use any SSH client, for example, PuTTY.


To connect, you need the following data:


*   SSH-server - IP of your server
*   Username
*   Password


To find this information go to Products/Services - select the appropriate server - Instructions.

By DCI manager or VM Manager panel


You can manage the server directly from the Control Panel of the server: [DCI Manager panel](\"https://dci-ed.gcore.lu/dcimgr\") and [VM Manager panel](\"https://kvmmgr.gcore.lu/vmmgr?sfrom=loginform\")


To log in, you need a login and password from the DCI panel. Find them in the email that was sent to you after the server was activated, or in the section with the instructions for this server. The credentials do not match the login and password for the Control panel.
