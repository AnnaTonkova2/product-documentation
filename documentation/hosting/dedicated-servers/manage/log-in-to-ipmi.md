IPMI is an interface for remote monitoring and managing the physical state of the server. For example, IPMI provides a way to power on, power off, reboot server remotely or reinstall OS using ISO. 

We provide IPMI access for the dedicated servers in all locations.

How to get access to IPMI

Go to the Dedicated server section, choose an active server and click the **To panel** button.
