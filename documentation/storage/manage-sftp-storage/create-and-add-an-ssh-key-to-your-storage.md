Specify a name for your key using letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. It can't be longer than 128 symbols. The field can't be left empty.

Copy your key to the "Text" field or upload it from the file by clicking on the **Upload from file** button.

To assign keys to storages go to the Storages section and choose SSH keys manager in the drop-down menu.
